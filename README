Thecus N5550 Hardware Support
Copyright 2013 Ian Pilcher <arequipeno@gmail.com>
=================================================

For RHEL/CentOS/Scientific Linux 6.  Requires kernel-ml (and kernel-ml-devel)
from elrepo.


Kernel Modules
--------------

n5550_ahci_leds - "Hooks" into libahci module to provide LED triggers for disk
	activity.  Must be loaded *before* any other modules (such as ahci) that
	use libahci.

	Can only be unloaded after being disabled with:

		echo 0 > /sys/class/n5550_ahci_leds/enabled

	Disabling will only work if no other libahci users are loaded.

n5550_board - Sets up chipset, LEDs, GPIOs, etc.  Disk activity LEDs have
	default triggers, so they should "just work" once both modules are
	loaded.


Configuration Files
-------------------

modprobe_n5550.conf - Copy to /etc/modprobe.d/n5550.conf.  Makes modprobe load
	n5550_ahci_leds whenever it loads libahci.

dracut_n5550.conf - Copy to /etc/dracut.conf.d/n5550.conf.  Makes dracut
	include n5550_ahci_leds module in initramfs.


LCD
---

test2.c - Can be used to reset and send messages to the ATmega168 micro-
	controller which manages the front-panel LCD.
