Thecus N5550 Hardware Support
Copyright 2013 Ian Pilcher <arequipeno@gmail.com>
=================================================

For RHEL/CentOS/Scientific Linux 6.  Requires kernel-ml (and kernel-ml-devel)
from elrepo.


Kernel Modules
--------------

n5550_ahci_leds - "Hooks" into libahci module to provide LED triggers for disk
	activity.  Must be loaded *before* any other modules (such as ahci) that
	use libahci.

	Can only be unloaded after being disabled with:

		echo 0 > /sys/class/n5550_ahci_leds/enabled

	Disabling will only work if no other libahci users are loaded.

n5550_board - Sets up chipset, LEDs, GPIOs, etc.  Disk activity LEDs have
	default triggers, so they should "just work" once both modules are
	loaded.


Configuration Files
-------------------

modprobe_n5550.conf - Copy to /etc/modprobe.d/n5550.conf.  Makes modprobe load
	n5550_ahci_leds whenever it loads libahci.

dracut_n5550.conf - Copy to /etc/dracut.conf.d/n5550.conf.  Makes dracut
	include n5550_ahci_leds module in initramfs.


LCD
---

test2.c - Can be used to reset and send messages to the ATmega168 micro-
	controller which manages the front-panel LCD.


Buttons
-------

I have not been able to read button presses/status from the ATmega168.  However,
it is possible to read them via jumper block next to the LCD connection.  These
jumpers are used by the Thecus firmware to identify the NAS model on which it is
running, and they are readable via GPIO pins on one of the PCA9532 LED dimmers
(currently GPIOs 16-19).

To do this, remove the 3 jumpers from the block and shift the button module
ribbon cable from its normal connector onto the jumper block.  (After doing
this, the Thecus firmware will not function properly ... unless someone figures
out the proper button to hold down while it is booting.)
